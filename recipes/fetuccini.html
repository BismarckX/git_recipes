    <h2>Description.-</h2>
    <p>This homemade alfredo sauce is made with simple ingredients -- butter, parmesan cheese, garlic, heavy cream, and salt. It's a 5-ingredient alfredo sauce that is beyond easy!</p>
    <p>This homemade alfredo sauce can be tossed with the pasta so the pasta soaks up all of the sauce or it can be spooned over hot, fresh pasta.  I love to use fresh refrigerated fettuccine noodles because it tastes that much better. !</p>
    <p>If you want the fettuccine alfredo to be a little more "saucy" toss the sauce with less than one pound of pasta (you may start with 12 ounces of fettuccine.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>  1 lb Fettuccine Pasta </li>
        <li>  6 Tablespoons Butter  </li>
        <li>  Garlic Clove (minced) </li>
        <li>  1 1/2 cups Heavy Cream  </li>
        <li>  1/4 teaspoon Salt </li>
        <li>  1 1/4 cup Shredded Parmesan Cheese  </li>
        <li>  1/4 teaspoon Pepper </li>
        <li>  2 Tablespoons Italian Parsley (optional) </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, heat water over high heat until boiling. Add salt to season the water. Once it is boiling, add fettuccine and cook according to package instructions. </li>
        <li>In a large skillet or pan, heat butter over medium heat. Add minced garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in heavy cream. </li>
        <li>Let heavy cream reduce and cook for 5 to 8 minutes. Add half of the parmesan cheese to the mixture and whisk well until smooth. Keep over heat and whisk well until cheese is melted.</li>
        <li>Save some pasta water. The pasta water is full of flavor and can be used to thin out the sauce.</li>
        <li>Toss alfredo sauce with fettuccine pasta and add half of the parmesan cheese. Once it is tossed, garnish with the remaining parmesan cheese. Add a little pasta water if it needs to be thinned out.</li>
        <li>Garnish with Italian parsley, if so desired.</li>
