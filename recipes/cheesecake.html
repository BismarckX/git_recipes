        <li>Put a rack in the middle of over and preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        <li>Beat cream cheese in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until fluffy. Reduce speed to low and add eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.</li>
        <li>Add 1 cup sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla and mix until well combined, scraping down sides of bowl with a spatula as needed.</li>
        <li>Put springform pan with crust on a baking sheet with sides (to catch any drips). Pour filling into crust. Bake until cake is set 3 inches from edge but center is still slightly wobbly, about 45 minutes. Cool in pan on a rack for 5 minutes. (Leave oven on). </li>
        <li>During the last 10 minutes of cheesecake baking. Stir together sour cream, vanilla, and powdered sugar in a medium size bowl. Set to the side.</li>
        <li>Remove the cheesecake from the oven. Pour sour cream topping in the middle of cheesecake. Use a spatula to smooth the topping all over the top of the cake. Make sure to leave a half inch of cheesecake exposed. Bake cheesecake for 10 minutes more. </li>
        <li>Turn the oven off. Let the cheesecake rest in the oven for 20 minutes with the door cracked open.</li>
        <li>Remove the cheesecake from the oven. Run a knife around the top edge of cake to loosen it. Then let it cool completely in pan on a wire rack for about 1 hour. (Cake will continue to set as it cools).</li>
        <li>Refrigerate cake, loosely covered, for at least 4-6 hours. Remove side of pan, transfer cake to plate, serve cold or bring to room temperature before serving.</li>
